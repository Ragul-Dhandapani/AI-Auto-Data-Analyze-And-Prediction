The previous AI engineer tackled a wide array of tasks for the PROMISE AI platform, focusing on stabilization and feature expansion. Initial work involved resolving persistent Oracle RDS client issues, enhancing UI/UX, and integrating 30+ new ML models with Azure OpenAI, replacing Emergent LLM. A significant portion of the work involved a comprehensive documentation overhaul, which evolved from linking markdown files to dynamically updating UI content. Recurring challenges included Oracle client installation and configuration, JSON serialization issues for data previews, and frontend display inconsistencies for visualizations and ML model comparisons. Towards the end, the engineer systematically integrated Azure OpenAI across all backend services and initiated the development of a sophisticated, context-aware AI chat assistant based on detailed user requirements. The trajectory concludes with the foundation of this chat service in place and a dedicated test endpoint created.

<product_requirements>
The PROMISE AI platform is an AI/ML web solution for data analysis and prediction, supporting MongoDB and Oracle 19c RDS. Key features requested include: ML Model Comparison, Hyperparameter Tuning explanation/speed, LLM-driven chat for requirements/chart generation, Oracle as default with compact database toggle, fixing bulk deletion, Auto Clean Data display, and Training Metadata recording. Further requests involved resolving visualization crashes, improving chart generation, integrating chat-generated charts, updating documentation (evolving into full UI content overhaul), and implementing 35+ new ML models with an enhanced selection UI and Azure OpenAI integration across the entire application. The most recent and significant request is for an advanced, context-aware AI chat assistant capable of data awareness, natural language chart creation/manipulation, prediction insights, interactive workflows (e.g., append to dashboard), and robust error/edge case handling, with a strong emphasis on comprehensive testing of all these capabilities.

The application uses a React.js frontend, a FastAPI backend, and supports both MongoDB and Oracle databases.



**Key File Changes & Importance:**
- ****: Modified  between  and  for testing and to eventually set Oracle as primary.  was also updated for .
- ****: Crucial fixes for Oracle client initialization () by ensuring the correct ARM64 library was used and explicitly setting . Enhanced  to handle JSON serialization of  by replacing non-JSON compliant floats. Added methods for , , ,  to support training history.
- ****: Added , , ,  for database compatibility.
- ****: Updated the abstract base adapter to include the new training metadata methods for consistent interface.
- ****: Added  definition, including foreign keys and indexes, to persist ML training results.
- ****: Modified  to automatically detect problem types (classification/regression) and to save all trained models (35+) and their metrics to the new  table. Fixed  reference which was incorrectly pointing to the  table instead of .
- ****: Fixed  endpoint to correctly handle non-JSON serializable values (NaN, Inf) in  by converting them to strings before JSON serialization, preventing  check constraint violations. Also cleaned the response.
- ****: The  endpoint was refactored to query and return actual ML training metadata from the new  table instead of workspace states.
- ****: Integrated Azure OpenAI client and environment variables for enhanced hyperparameter tuning insights.
- ****: Integrated Azure OpenAI client for improved variable intelligence capabilities.
- ****: Integrated Azure OpenAI client for generating model explanations.
- ****: Integrated Azure OpenAI client for time series analysis and insights.
- ****: **New file created** to encapsulate the logic for the advanced AI-powered chat assistant, handling data awareness, chart generation, prediction insights, and user interaction workflows as per the latest requirements.
- ****: **New file created** to serve as a test endpoint for the .
- ****: Underwent a significant overhaul. Initially, it was updated to link new  files (, , ). Following user feedback, it was then comprehensively updated to *display content directly within the UI*, removing the links to  files. This included updating sections like 6+ algorithms to 35+ ML models, revamping the Architecture tab to reflect Azure OpenAI and current data flow, and updating the FAQ section to cover new features and database switching. Also, fixed a runtime error by importing  icon.
- ****: Updated to fetch  from  state instead of potentially stale  data, ensuring  displays correct models. Addressed ML Model Comparison not displaying by ensuring  is correctly populated from the backend.
- ****: Added a console log for debugging  prop.
- ****: Modified to correctly process chart data received from the backend by mapping the  field to , resolving the No visualizations could be generated issue when backend returned valid charts. It was also updated to accept  prop.
- ****: Updated to pass the  prop to the  component.
- ****, ****, ****: **New files created** during the initial phase of the documentation overhaul, but their content was later integrated directly into .

<pending_tasks>
- Integrate the newly created  route into the main application.
- Thoroughly test all aspects of the Enhanced Chat Assistant against the detailed user requirements (data awareness, chart creation/manipulation, prediction/model insights, user interaction workflows, error handling, UI flow integration, natural language flexibility, and analytical assistance).
- Provide evidence for each tested scenario of the Enhanced Chat Assistant.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on developing a comprehensive, AI-powered chat assistant. This involved completing the  file to handle advanced natural language processing, data contextualization, and interactive chart manipulation. A dedicated testing endpoint, , was created to systematically validate the functionalities of this new service. The last action was about to integrate this new test route into the main application. This work follows a long series of critical bug fixes and enhancements, including fully migrating all relevant backend services to use Azure OpenAI, resolving persistent Oracle client connectivity issues, implementing a robust training metadata tracking system for all 35+ ML models, fixing JSON serialization errors during dataset uploads, and correcting visualization display issues on the frontend.
