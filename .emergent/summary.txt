<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial request to complete an AutoML feature evolved into a major overhaul of the application. Key requirements included:

1.  **Model Export Overhaul:** Create a feature to export multiple models as a ZIP file containing , a , and runnable Python scripts.
2.  **Database Stability:** Fix critical Failed to load datasets errors caused by a fragile and incorrect Oracle Database client installation. The user later requested a full switch to Oracle, including a complete schema redesign.
3.  **Workspace-Centric Design:** A major user-driven initiative to enforce a workspace structure. All data uploads and analyses must be organized within workspaces to allow for better project management and historical model comparison.
4.  **UI/UX Fixes:**
    *   Address performance degradation in the Predictive Analysis feature.
    *   Fix missing UI sections (, ).
    *   Reorder the sections in the Predictive Analysis screen to a specific layout.
    -   Remove redundant Export Model buttons.
5.  **New Features:**
    *   Add an Enable AutoML toggle during file upload.
    *   Implement an AI-powered Hyperparameter Tuning Suggestions section.
    *   Create a Model Monitoring dashboard.
    *   Develop a method to calculate a holistic score for models within a workspace.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a React frontend with a FastAPI backend, now configured to use an **Oracle** database as its primary data store. A major effort was made to stabilize the Oracle connection by installing the correct ARM64 client and creating a recovery script.

The application's architecture has been fundamentally changed to be **workspace-centric**. The backend API and frontend UI now enforce the creation or selection of a workspace before any data can be uploaded or analyzed.

Key features like Model Export, an AutoML toggle, and backend services for AI-powered hyperparameter suggestions have been implemented. However, following a user request, the agent **dropped and rebuilt the entire Oracle database schema** with a new, clean, hierarchical design. This has broken the data access layer.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: The agent was updating the  to align with the newly rebuilt Oracle schema. The user requested a complete schema redesign, which involved dropping all tables and creating new ones with a hierarchical structure ( ->  -> ). The  (BLOB) was moved directly into the  table. The agent updated the code for storing files but did not fix the code for retrieving them.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: backend testing agent
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1**: Oracle data adapter is broken after schema rebuild (P0)

Issues Detail:
-   **Issue 1: Oracle data adapter is broken after schema rebuild**
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent successfully rebuilt the Oracle schema and updated the  method in . However, other critical data access methods were not updated.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Open .
        2.  Modify the  method. It currently fails because it queries a non-existent  table. Update it to select  directly from the  table.
        3.  Review and correct all other dataset-related methods in the file (, , , ) to ensure they use the new table and column names (, , etc.).
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is a critical P0 blocker. The application's core functionality (file upload, dataset retrieval, analysis) is completely broken on the user-preferred Oracle database. Fixing this will make the application usable again.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: backend
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete UI for New Features**
    -   **Where to resume**:
        1.  Flesh out the stub components: , , and .
        2.  Integrate the  component into  to display the AI suggestions.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: This will deliver several key features requested by the user, making the new dashboards and suggestions visible and interactive.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend
    -   **Blocked on something**: , as the frontend UI depends on a functional backend API.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**

-   **Upcoming Tasks**:
    -   **P0: Reorder Sections in Predictive Analysis**: Edit  to rearrange the UI sections into the user-specified order: Key Correlations, ML Model Comparison, Forecast & Insights, Actual vs Prediction, Outliers, Business Recommendations, Volume Insights.
    -   **P1: Implement Holistic Workspace Score**: Design and implement backend logic to calculate an aggregate performance score for all models within a workspace and create a new API endpoint to serve this data.
    -   **P2: Connect AutoML Toggle to Backend**: Ensure the  flag from the UI toggle is correctly passed in the  API call and used by the backend to trigger hyperparameter tuning.
-   **Future Tasks**:
    -   **P2: Implement Differentiator Features**: Implement logic for Custom Model Support, Model Monitoring, and Instant API Deployment.
    -   **P3: Implement Domain-Specific Visualizations**: Add logic to  to generate meaningful charts.
    -   **P3: Optimize Large File Uploads**: The current upload mechanism is not optimized for large files.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Database Overhaul**:
    -   Successfully stabilized the **Oracle** connection, making it the primary database.
    -   **Dropped and rebuilt the entire Oracle schema** from scratch with a new, clean, hierarchical design as per user request.
    -   Resolved complex Oracle LOB (BLOB/CLOB) serialization errors.
-   **Workspace Feature Implementation**:
    -   Implemented a full-fledged workspace management system on both backend and frontend.
    -   The UI now **enforces workspace selection** before any data source operation.
-   **Feature Implementation**:
    -   Rewrote the broken **Model Export** feature from the ground up.
    -   Added a UI toggle for enabling **AutoML**.
    -   Implemented an AI-powered backend service for **Hyperparameter Tuning Suggestions**.
-   **UI/UX Improvements**:
    -   Removed redundant Export Model buttons from the model comparison table.
    -   Added workspace selection UI to all data source tabs (File Upload, Database, Custom Query).
-   **Documentation**:
    -   Created , , and helper scripts () for database management.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   The section reordering in  has been requested multiple times but not yet implemented.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: Oracle Client Installation is Not Persistent.
-   **Recurrence count**: High
-   **Status**: RESOLVED (within the session). The agent created a recovery script () and configured the environment correctly. The next agent should be aware that this script may be needed after an environment reset.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Database**: **Oracle 19c on ARM64 (aarch64)** is the primary database. The schema is newly designed and hierarchical.
-   **Architecture**: A **Workspace-centric architecture** is now enforced across the application. All data and analysis are scoped to a workspace.
-   **Oracle Specifics**: The agent has dealt with , LOB object handling (BLOBs/CLOBs), and  environment setup.

**key DB schema**
-   **WORKSPACES**:  (PK), , 
-   **DATASETS**:  (PK),  (FK), ,  (BLOB)
-   **TRAINING_METADATA**:  (PK),  (FK),  (FK), ,  (CLOB)

**changes in tech stack**
-   Definitive switch to **Oracle** as the primary database with a brand-new, custom schema.

**All files**
-   **Created Files**:
    -   : Manages workspace CRUD operations.
    -   : Provides AI-powered tuning advice.
    -   , , : Stubs for new UI features.
    -   , : Database schema and initialization scripts.
-   **Heavily Updated Files**:
    -   : Rewritten to support the new schema, but contains critical bugs.
    -   : Overhauled to implement the mandatory workspace selection flow.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-    and  are both extremely large and complex. They should be broken down into smaller, single-responsibility components to improve maintainability.

**key api endpoints**
-    & : Manage workspaces.
-   : Get AI-powered tuning advice.
-   : Uploads a file, now requires a .
-   : Switches between  and .

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Your first task is to fix the Oracle data adapter.** The application is configured for Oracle, but file operations are broken because  is not fully aligned with the new database schema. You must fix the methods for retrieving data (e.g., ) before any other work can proceed.
-   **The application is now workspace-centric.** This is a core design principle mandated by the user. All new features and fixes must respect this structure.
-   **The Oracle client installation is ephemeral.** If the backend fails to start with a  error, run the ======================================

**Last 5 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User (msg 478)**: Confirmed their desire to use Oracle.
2.  **User (msg 501)**: Reported a file upload failure (), which was an early sign of schema mismatch.
3.  **User (msg 562)**: Pointed out another UI issue (missing workspace option in custom query tab) and urged the agent to continue fixing Oracle LOB issues.
4.  **User (msg 589)**: Reported another analysis failure and then gave a crucial directive: **I would suggest you delete all tables and schema in oracle db and create newly schema and tables with new design** and requested the holistic score feature.
5.  **User (msg 600)**: This was the agent's last action (completing the schema rebuild). The user has not responded, but the pending requests from msg 589 (implement holistic score, ensure new design works) are still active.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken**: Core functionality (file upload, dataset listing, analysis) is broken on Oracle due to the data adapter being out of sync with the new DB schema.
-   **Mocked**: Several frontend components (, ) are non-functional stubs.
-   **Brittle**: The Oracle client installation can disappear on environment reset, requiring a manual script run to fix.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes**: YES, but the test results are now outdated as they were performed before the complete database schema rebuild.
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO
-   **Test files created**: None.
-   **Known regressions**: File upload and data retrieval on Oracle are non-functional, a regression from a previously working state before the schema was rebuilt.

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent did not fully update  after rebuilding the schema, leaving critical functions like  broken.
-   The agent has not yet implemented the UI section reordering in , despite multiple user requests.
-   The agent has not implemented the holistic score for workspaces, a key part of the user's last major request.
-   The connection between the frontend Enable AutoML toggle and the backend analysis logic has not been completed.</analysis>
