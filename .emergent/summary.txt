The AI engineer's work involved extensive stabilization and feature expansion for the PROMISE AI platform. Initial efforts concentrated on resolving a recurring Oracle RDS client issue, addressing UI/UX bugs, and optimizing hyperparameter tuning. A significant focus was on implementing 30+ new ML models with a comprehensive selection UI and integrating Azure OpenAI for advanced insights and chat, replacing the existing Emergent LLM. Throughout the process, the engineer tackled persistent Oracle client installation failures, backend errors related to Azure OpenAI deployment names, ML training data preprocessing (NaN handling), Oracle date format inconsistencies, UI rendering problems for the ModelSelector, and ML Model Comparison, missing problem types in the Variable Selection Modal, and UI overlap with numerous selected models. The work also involved updating backend services and frontend components to leverage Azure OpenAI, ensure data persistence using , and improve UI responsiveness. Most recently, the engineer was tasked with a complete overhaul of the application's documentation.

<product_requirements>
The PROMISE AI platform is an AI/ML web solution for data analysis and prediction, supporting MongoDB and Oracle 19c RDS. The user initially requested: ML Model Comparison, Hyperparameter Tuning explanation and speed reduction, LLM-driven chat for requirements and chart generation, setting Oracle as default with a compact database toggle, fixing bulk deletion, Auto Clean Data display, and Training Metadata recording. Further requirements included addressing visualization crashes, improving chart generation speed and variety, integrating chat-generated charts, updating documentation, and implementing 30+ new ML models with an enhanced selection UI and Azure OpenAI integration. Later, the user explicitly requested replacing all Emergent LLM usage with Azure OpenAI and a complete documentation overhaul.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a comprehensive documentation overhaul. This involved checking the Oracle client installation (which was reinstalled), and creating new documentation files as per user instructions.  and  have already been created. The engineer was in the process of creating the remaining documentation files (, , and ) and was about to update the UI's Documentation section to incorporate these new resources. This follows a long series of fixes and enhancements, including fully migrating to Azure OpenAI, resolving persistent Oracle connectivity issues, enhancing ML model handling with 35+ models and NaN handling, improving frontend UI/UX for model selection and visualization, and ensuring state persistence for analysis results.
